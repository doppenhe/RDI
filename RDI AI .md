# üõ†Ô∏è **AI for R&D Ventures: Hands-On Examples and Prompts**

Below are carefully prepared, easy-to-follow examples. Students can directly copy and adapt prompts and processes for their venture research:

## üìå **Phase 2: Opportunity Exploration & Validation**

### **1. Generating Structured Customer Interview Guides:**
```markdown
You are a product researcher. Generate a structured interview guide of 8-10 questions to validate the following idea:

- Idea: "[Clearly state your venture idea here]"
- Goal: Identify pain points, existing alternatives, customer behavior, and willingness to pay.
- Audience: "[Your specific target customer persona]"
```

### **2. AI-Assisted Interview Note-taking & Summary:**
- **Using Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, Gong.io:**  
  - Record and auto-transcribe interviews.
  - Export transcripts.

- **Prompt for Transcript Summarization (ChatGPT/Claude):**
```markdown
Given this customer interview transcript:
[Paste transcript]

Summarize clearly:
- Main customer pain points mentioned.
- Notable objections or concerns raised.
- Indicators of potential willingness to pay.
Provide the summary as bullet points.
```

### **3. Cross-Interview Thematic Analysis:**
```markdown
Here are summaries from five customer interviews:
[Summaries pasted here]

Identify clearly:
- Common themes or patterns (pain points, unmet needs).
- Recurring objections or concerns.
- Insights on willingness to pay and feature prioritization.

Provide a structured summary, clearly indicating each theme and its frequency.
```

### **4. Advanced Schema Matching & Inferring Missing Data:**
```markdown
Here‚Äôs a structured question bank (10 questions):
[Insert question bank]

Below is a raw interview transcript:
[Insert transcript]

The interviewer only explicitly asked questions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10. Using the provided transcript, infer likely responses for questions 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9. For each inferred answer, clearly state:

- The inferred response.
- Your confidence level (high/medium/low).
- Brief justification based on transcript evidence.
```

## üìå **Phase 3: Building & Testing Solutions**

### **1. Generating Mermaid.js Diagrams for Excalidraw:**
- **Prompt (Claude/ChatGPT):**
```markdown
Create a Mermaid.js flowchart for the customer onboarding process of a new SaaS app, including steps: User Sign-up ‚Üí Welcome Survey ‚Üí Trial Activation ‚Üí First-time Feature Walkthrough.
```
- Copy Mermaid output ‚Üí paste directly into Excalidraw‚Äôs Mermaid Diagram feature.

### **2. Technical Prototyping & MVP Coding:**
- **Example Prompt (Cursor/Replit/Copilot):**
```python
# Prompt example:
# Build a simple Python Flask API endpoint that handles basic user registration (name, email) and saves to SQLite database.
```

### **3. Iterative Feedback Simulation:**
```markdown
Here‚Äôs a short product description:
[Brief product or feature description]

Simulate three rounds of user feedback. Clearly list:
- Round 1: Positive reactions, initial complaints.
- Round 2: Responses after first improvements.
- Round 3: Final feedback & remaining concerns.

Provide concise recommendations after each round.
```
